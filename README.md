## Instructions

* Analyzed data of four thousand past Kickstarter projects to uncover some of the market trends

* What are three conclusions we can make about Kickstarter campaigns given the provided data?
  1.	The theater category has the most campaigns. Looking at the graph it looks like the music category has the most successful campaigns relative to failed and canceled campaigns.
  2.	The most campaign subcategories are plays. There were a quite a few subcategories where all the campaigns were successful; including rock, classical music, metal, electronic music, documentary, nonfiction, radio & podcasts, shorts, tabletop games, television, and hardware. All animation, drama, fiction, gadgets, restaurants, and video game campaigns failed.
  3.	There was a spike of successful campaigns in May. Successful campaigns are at their lowest in December, where the number of failures exceeded the number of successful campaigns. The lowest number of failures were in February and April. The year 2015 had the most campaigns
  
* What are some of the limitations of this dataset?
How are the categories and subcategories assigned? Are they selected by the creator or are they assigned automatically? Either way some campaigns may be incorrectly assigned. Additionally, since the currencies are not standardized as one currency, it is complicated to make one-to-one comparisons. It’s unclear what the columns containing True/False values represents so they aren’t variables we can analyze.

* What are some other possible tables/graphs that we could create?
I think it would be beneficial to calculate % and rate of successful/failed for categories and subcategories to see if the have a higher success/failure rate. It would also be interesting to stratify that by country to see if there are category preferences by country.
